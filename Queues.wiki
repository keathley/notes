Much of this is pulled from The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis

== Open and Closed Queues ==
* Open Queues have external arrivals and departures
* Closed queues have no external arrivals or departures.

== Operational Laws ==

=== Utilization law ===

utilization = busy_time/T = completions/T * busy_time/completions

=== Little's Law ===

total number in queue = arrival rate * mean time in device

If the job flow is balanced then the arrivale rate is equal to the throughput.
This lets us say that

total number in queue = throughput * mean time in queue

Little's law allows us to derive response times:

Given a queue with a throughput of 35.84 and an average queue length of 8.88 then
the response time of the processor is:

8.88/35.84 = ~0.25 seconds
